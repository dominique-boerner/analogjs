## Create a new Theme

To create a new theme, it is best to make a copy of the folder "css/themes/default/".

A theme is made up of three different files:

### clock.css

Describes the design of the watch ring and the point in the middle.

### hands.css

Describes the design of the different watch hands.

### [theme-name].css

Imports clock.css and hands.css, also contains a configuration for your own theme in the form of CSS variables.
